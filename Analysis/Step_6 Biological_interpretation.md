## Step 6: Biological Interpretation
### Objective
The objective of this step was to biologically interpret the results obtained from BLAST-based homology search and functional annotation in order to predict the function of the unknown protein sequence.

### Interpretation of BLAST Results (Step 4)
BLAST analysis revealed that the target protein shows strong similarity to Type surface antigen 47 (47 kDa/HtrA) from *Orientia tsutsugamushi*. The identification of an HtrA/DegP homolog as the top BLAST hit suggests that the target protein belongs to the HtrA family of serine proteases and shares a common evolutionary origin with known proteins of this family.

### Interpretation of Functional Annotation (Step 5)
Conserved domain analysis identified the presence of a degP_htrA_DO domain spanning a major portion of the protein sequence, indicating that the protein is highly conserved and functionally intact. Additional annotation using InterPro and SMART databases confirmed that the protein belongs to the HtrA-related serine protease family (Peptidase S1C).

The protein contains a trypsin-like serine protease domain, suggesting proteolytic activity, along with two PDZ domains that are known to facilitate protein–protein interactions. These features indicate that the protein is capable of recognizing and degrading misfolded or damaged proteins.

Signal peptide prediction revealed that the protein is a Sec-dependent secreted protein, and subcellular localization analysis using PSORTb predicted that the mature protein is localized in the periplasmic region.

### Predicted Biological Function
Based on homology, conserved domain architecture, and subcellular localization, the target protein is predicted to function as a periplasmic serine protease involved in protein quality control. The protein likely plays an important role in degrading misfolded or damaged proteins and contributes to stress resistance during active exponential growth.

### Limitations
The predicted function of the target protein is based solely on computational and homology-based analyses. Experimental validation would be required to confirm the precise biological role and enzymatic activity of the protein.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, integration of BLAST homology results and functional annotation strongly suggests that the target sequence encodes a periplasmic HtrA/DegP-like serine protease involved in protein quality control and stress response. This demonstrates the effectiveness of computational bioinformatics approaches in predicting the biological function of an unknown protein sequence.
